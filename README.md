<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>
In this activity, you will conduct a vulnerability assessment for a small business.

<h2>Description</h2>

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

<h2>System Description</h2>

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on
the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management
system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts
with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

<h2>Scope</h2>

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system.
The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP
800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The database server stores and manages a large amount of data. It is important for the business to secure the data because it may contain personal information that is used for data analytics and campaigns. It is important to secure the system to keep the customers trust.

<h2>Approach</h2>

I selected these three specific threat sources based on their potential to significantly disrupt business operations and compromise sensitive data. Hackers pose a high risk by exfiltrating confidential information, which could result in financial loss or legal repercussions. Employees can inadvertently or maliciously disrupt critical operations, while customers altering or deleting critical data could harm the businessâ€™s integrity. These events are significant because they directly impact the continuity, security, and trust in business processes.

<h2>Remediation Strategy</h2>

To mitigate the identified risks, several security controls can be implemented. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access controls can prevent unauthorized access and limit employee privileges to mission-critical systems. Data encryption, both at rest and in transit, will protect sensitive information from exfiltration by hackers. Regular system audits and monitoring can detect unusual activities, such as unauthorized data alterations by customers. Additionally, implementing endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems can help prevent insider threats by identifying and containing potential disruptions.
